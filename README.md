# Awesome T-Shirt Shop

Awesome T-Shirt Shop is a simple React-based shopping cart app. The idea is to demonstrate React Router functionality.

## Technologies

- React 17
- Create-react-app
- React Router 6
- React Bootstrap 2
- Sass

App logic was realized with React Context API and useReducer.

## Assets

- React Icons

## Desing Inspiration

- Webflow.com templates

## Lessons Learned

- React Bootstrap Tooltip bug: it remains visible after cart opens on mobile devices.
- PurgeCss does not work with React Bootstrap unless explicit classnames are used. Its use was abandoned in this project.
